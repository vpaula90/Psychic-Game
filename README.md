# Psychic-Game


This is a Letter guessing game. As the player you will click on a letter on your computer keyboard. If the letter you pick matches the letter randomly generated by the computer you will add to your wins. If you do not guess correctly for 9 guesses you will lose a point. Once you run out of the 9 guesses your guesses will reset and your computer will generate another random letter for you to guess.

Using variables, functions, if/else and get.documentById I was able to have the computer randomly generate a letter and have the user pick a letter, store it in the array variable when wrong, increase wins/ losses count and decrease guesses left for the user.
